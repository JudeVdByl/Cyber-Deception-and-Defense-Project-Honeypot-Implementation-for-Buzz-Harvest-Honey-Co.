# Cyber Deception and Defense Project: Honeypot Implementation for Buzz & Harvest Honey Co.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to strengthen the cybersecurity defenses of Buzz & Harvest Honey Co. by designing, implementing, and monitoring a honeypot system. This honeypot was intended to simulate the company's IT environment to attract and analyze cyber threats, thereby enabling the company to develop more effective countermeasures.

## Project Summary

A recent sophisticated cyberattack on Buzz & Harvest Honey Co. highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the company’s digital defenses. The attack disrupted operations, caused financial losses, and damaged the company’s reputation. To address these issues, a honeypot system was proposed and implemented to attract attackers and gather actionable intelligence on their methods.
